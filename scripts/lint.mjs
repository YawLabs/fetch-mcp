/**
 * Run biome against a binary that actually works on this host.
 *
 * Everywhere except Windows ARM64 this is a thin passthrough to the platform
 * binary npm installed. On Windows ARM64 it provisions the x64 build OF THE
 * SAME VERSION into a gitignored cache and runs that under emulation instead.
 *
 * Why: SOME `@biomejs/cli-win32-arm64` builds are broken, and which ones is not
 * predictable from the version number. Measured on a win32-arm64 host
 * (2026-09-11): 2.5.4 exits 139 on every CHECK-shaped run (it answers --version fine) -- the `.bin/biome`
 * shim, `biome.cmd` from PowerShell (STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION 0xC0000005), and
 * the binary invoked directly with no npm in the picture -- while 2.4.16 and
 * 2.5.13 both run correctly on the same host (exit 0 on a clean tree, exit 1
 * naming the file on a real finding). So this is neither a permanent arm64
 * defect nor a fault in npm's run-script wrapper: it is a per-version
 * packaging bug in the arm64 executable.
 *
 * The x64 build of every version measured runs fine under Windows' x64
 * emulation, so routing through it on this host trades a little startup time
 * for a result that does not depend on whether the version currently installed
 * happens to be one of the broken ones. `YAWLABS_BIOME_NATIVE=1` runs the
 * platform binary anyway, which is correct on any version whose arm64 build is
 * unaffected.
 *
 * Why this is a script and not a devDependency: npm refuses to install
 * `@biomejs/cli-win32-x64` on an arm64 host (EBADPLATFORM), which is precisely
 * the situation we are working around, so it cannot be declared normally. The
 * install below passes `--force` for that reason and `--no-save` so the
 * workaround never leaks into package.json.
 *
 * Why it matters here specifically: this repo has no .github directory at all
 * and GitHub Actions is disabled on it, so there is no runner to arbitrate
 * formatting later. (release.sh has CI-mode branches keyed on
 * .github/workflows/release.yml, but no such workflow exists.) Whatever this
 * script reports is the ONLY lint signal that exists before `release.sh`
 * publishes to npm.
 *
 * Escape hatches, in case the platform assumption ages badly:
 *   YAWLABS_BIOME_BIN=<path>   use exactly this binary, skip all detection
 *   YAWLABS_BIOME_NATIVE=1     force the normal platform binary on any host
